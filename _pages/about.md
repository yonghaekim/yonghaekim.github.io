I'm a cloud software architect at Security and Privacy Research (SPR) in Intel Labs. Before joining Intel, I <s>am</s> was a Ph.D student at Georgia Tech where I was advised by Prof. Hyesoon Kim. My research interests span computer architecture, security, and compiler. I'm currently working on effective mitigation against memory safety vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflow and use-after-free, with lightweight micro-architectural and compiler support.
